# Secrets API Project

This project utilizes Express.js and Axios to fetch a random secret from an external API (`https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/random`) and displays it along with the associated username.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or create a new directory for this project.
3. Inside the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install express axios
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.js` file.
2. Replace `"index.ejs"` with the correct path to your EJS file if it's located in a different directory.
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000/` to view the fetched secret and username.

## File Structure

- `index.js`: Contains the Express server setup and route to fetch and render a random secret and associated username.
- `public/`: Directory for serving static files.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Web application framework for Node.js.
- `axios`: Promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.

## Notes

- If there are any errors in fetching the random secret, the server will log the error response data and return a status code of 500 to the client.
- Ensure proper error handling and security measures are implemented before deploying this code to a production environment.
